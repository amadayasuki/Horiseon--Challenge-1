# Horiseon - HTML CSS GIT CHALLENGE: CODE REFACTOR

### Description:
This weeks challenge is to take existing code and refactor it to make the existing site more accesible. I was tasked to insure the following: 
1. Links on the application function properly
2. CSS selectors and properties are organized and consolidated to follow a semantic structure
3. The CSS file is commented properly
4. Application deploys at the live URL and loads with no erros
5. GitHub repo contains:
- A unique name
- Good file structure/naming conventions
- Class/ID naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc
- Multiple commit messages
- A README file with a description, screenshots, and a link to the live application

### URL of the deployed application:
